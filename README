# This is Windows version of siMAYA.

Some components are disabled so it can run on Windows

How to start diving :

* Use console command line
* Clone the repo
* Go to project folder (we will call it `root`)
* `npm install`
* Go to folder: `ownbox`
* `npm install`
* Go to folder `sinergis-base`
* `npm install`

You will need to create symbolic link for two application folders : **ownbox** and **sinergis-base**. 
You can use Windows command `mklink` for this. In root folder

* `mklink ob ownbox\models`
* `mklink sinergis sinergis-base\sinergis`

then run the app!

`npm start`

or

`node app`

## Ignore this!

== If you get simaya source code from simaya repository, do this just after cloning:

git submodule init
git submodule update
